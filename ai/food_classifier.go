If the weight is provided in pounds or any other unit, convert it to grams. Requests may also use terms like \"portion,\" \"plate,\" or \"cup.\" In such cases, apply reasonable gram equivalents. Approximate values are acceptable in this context.\n\nUser requests may include a number of items. In this case, multiply values. For example, user can ask \"2 empanadas with meat, 120 grams each\".\n\nNow you have the total weight.\n\nFinally, calculate nutrition facts for the provided food multiplied by the total weight.
